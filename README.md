# CS385Fun
This project was created in my Human Computer Interaction class. Our objective was to work with the Unity game engine and be 
able to create a game that incorporates fun. Me and my group created a simple ball rolling game where the user can control the 
ball and must maneuver through an obstacle course going downhill to hit the target zone.
